### Day 1: Fundamentals (29/05/2024)

Today marked the beginning of my journey to revisit fundamental concepts in **Linear Algebra**. I used the esteemed [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) as my primary guide, particularly focusing on Chapters 2 and 3, alongside detailed annotations available [here](add link).

During my reading, I felt the need to brush up on eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which led me to explore these concepts through two educational videos:

- [Practical Exercise of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVeuZzJdd1w)
- [An animated look at Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&t=789s)

After consolidating my notes, I sought practical applications to better grasp these concepts using Python. My exploration began with understanding eigenvectors through Python, demonstrated in this video:

- [Eigenvectors in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxkGMbrobY0)

Please refer to the jupyter notebook at: `Linear Algebra/eigen_vectors.ipynb`

Continuing with practical applications, I delved into Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python, guided by an insightful tutorial:

- [Principal Component Analysis in Python](https://www.jeremykun.com/2012/06/28/principal-component-analysis/)

Please refer to the jupyter notebook at: `Linear Algebra/pca.ipynb`

This approach allowed me to not only refresh theoretical knowledge but also apply it practically, enhancing my comprehension of these critical subjects.
