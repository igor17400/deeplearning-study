### Day 2: Probability and Information Theory (30/05/2024)

Today, I continued my exploration in the [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), focusing on **Probability and Information Theory**. My detailed notes are available [here](add link).

During my study, I realized the need for visual representation to enhance my understanding of probability concepts. Having studied probability in a theoretical context, I decided to challenge myself by finding practical visual applications. I started with practical examples from [Seaborn's distribution tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html).

For more detailed visualizations, please consult the Jupyter notebook: `Probability/pratic_prob.ipynb`

To conclude the day on this probability part, I studied theoretical distributions using a guide found at [Medium](https://medium.com/@tubelwj/eight-probability-distribution-and-visualization-implemented-by-python-e4f304a3eafe), which provided insights into several probability distributions implemented in Python.

For theoretical distribution studies, refer to the Jupyter notebook: `Probability/prob_distributions.ipynb`

Next, let's focus on Information Theory.
