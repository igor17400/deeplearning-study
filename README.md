# Deep Learning Study Journal

Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository dedicated to documenting my journey through the study of deep learning.

## Background

I am a research scholar at The University of Tokyo with experience in deep learning. My journey has involved efforts to publish in top conferences. As I've immersed myself deeper into this fascinating area of artificial intelligence, I've come to realize the necessity of reinforcing my foundational knowledge to better understand advanced research and enhance my skills.

This repository is a compilation of reference codes, annotations, and personal insights I've gathered during my studies. It's designed to aid anyone eager to deepen their understanding of deep learning or explore this dynamic field.

## Study Diary

I will keep a personal diary detailing my daily studies and insights, ideal for those who wish to follow my exact path through this learning experience.

## Handwritten Summaries

For enthusiasts of handwritten notes, I will provide summaries in hand-written format within each section, as I personally find that handwriting enhances my connection with the material.

## Let’s Dive In!
